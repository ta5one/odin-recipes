    <p><h3><en>Pictured above is what the finished dish looks like</en></h3></p>
    <p>I'm showing you my take on domatokeftethes. These are incredibly delicious, versatile, and inexpensive, and they make a perfect summertime appetizer. Serve with freshly squeezed lemon, tzatziki sauce, or just plain Greek yogurt seasoned with raw minced garlic and lemon juice to taste.</p>
    <p>There are so many great ways to enjoy fresh, sweet summer tomatoes, and much to my shock and amazement, these Greek-style fritters could be my new favorite.</p>
    
    <p><h3>Ingredients:</h3></p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups diced fresh tomatoes with juices</li>
      <li>½ cup packed grated zucchini</li>
      <li>⅓ cup sliced green onions</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
      <li>3 ounces feta cheese, crumbled</li>
      <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Steps:</h3></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Stir together tomatoes, zucchini, green onions, kosher salt, sugar, black pepper, oregano, and cayenne in a bowl to combine.</li>
      <li>Let sit for 15 minutes for the sugar and salt to draw out liquids from the vegetables.</li> 
      <li>Stir the tomato mixture; add parsley, mint, and basil. Crumble in feta cheese. Add flour and baking powder; mix with a spoon until combined. Batter should be relatively loose but will hold its shape on a spoon. If too loose, add more flour; if too dry, add some water until desired consistency is reached.</li> 
      <li>Wrap the bowl in plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li> 
      <li>Heat 1 inch of vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), or use a deep fryer.</li> 
      <li>Place heaping tablespoonfuls of batter in the hot oil; reduce heat to medium. Fry until golden brown and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Flip once more and fry for an additional 30 seconds, if desired. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>   
    </ol>
